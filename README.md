# Learning Supercollider

I'm currently using supercollider version 3.9.3 and trying to figure out how I
can use this to make music.

# Tutorials I'm Using

### [Eli Fieldsteel's SuperCollider Video Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPYzvS8A_rTaNDweXe6PX4CXSGq4iEWYC)

As of this moment, I'm up to lesson 4 of this video series, but it is much
better than attempting to learn from reading through the manual. 

# My setup

I'm using SuperCollider version 3.9.3 on macOS with vim 8 and the
[supercollider/scvim](https://github.com/supercollider/scvim/) plugin.
I currently use iTerm2 as my main terminal and the `:SClangStart` currently
opens in the Terminal.app. I haven't yet tried to use it with tmux, but it
works pretty well right now and I'm happy about that.
