# Learning Supercollider

I'm currently using supercollider version 3.9.3 and trying to figure out how I
can use this to make music.

# Tutorials I'm Using

### [Eli Fieldsteel's SuperCollider Video Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPYzvS8A_rTaNDweXe6PX4CXSGq4iEWYC)

As of this moment, I'm up to lesson 4 of this video series, but it is much
better than attempting to learn from reading through the manual. 

# My setup

I'm using SuperCollider version 3.10.0 on macOS and Ubuntu 18.04.
On Ubuntu, I'm using vim 8 and the [supercollider/scvim](https://github.com/supercollider/scvim/) 
plugin. I had installed SuperCollider from source using the [instructions for
Linux](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/blob/master/README_LINUX.md)
help file. I haven't successfully installed it with gui support, but I was able
to get over a hurdle by installing `jackd2`, which was not listed. I cannot run
the server without starting sclang as root, though, which is really unfortunate.

For MacOS, I'm using the scide because it actually works there.
